# Rock Paper Scissors - Python text-based take on a classic!

Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequistes: all you need it Python 3 to play.

Clone the project, cd to your directory/download, and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for Mac/Linux, or the powershell for Windows.

The rules are the same as the classic game:
1. Paper covers rock
2. Scissors cuts paper
3. Rock smashes scissors

Choose you weapon wisely!

Built with Python 3

Derpy Derp Derp!
